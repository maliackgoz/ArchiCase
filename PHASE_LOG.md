# Phase Execution Log

Each agent appends its entry here after completing its phase. **Append-only** — never edit or delete prior entries. Corrections to an earlier phase go in a new `## Errata for Phase N` sub-section right after the original phase entry.

The very first entry below (Phase 0) is the scaffolding bootstrap and was written by the project setup, not by a phase agent. Phase agents start at Phase 1.

---

## Phase 0 — bootstrap (scaffolding) — initial setup

### What was built
- Root markdown documentation: `SPEC.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `PHASE_LOG.md` (this file), `README.md`, `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- 9 specialist agent definitions under `.claude/agents/`
- Empty `backend/` and `frontend/` directories with `.gitkeep` placeholders
- `.gitignore` and `.editorconfig`
- Initial git commit on `main`

### Key decisions
- Decision: bootstrap creates the initial git commit. Reason: spec lists "initialized git repo" as a deliverable. Alternative considered: leaving git init to the student — rejected to keep the first commit reproducible and to avoid a redundant README step.
- Decision: `backend/` and `frontend/` are tracked as empty (via `.gitkeep`) rather than created later by Phase 1 / Phase 8. Reason: keeps the directory tree predictable and makes the next agent's diff easier to review. Alternative considered: omitting them — rejected to avoid implicit `mkdir` work spread across agents.

### Files created
- `SPEC.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `PHASE_LOG.md`, `README.md`, `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`
- `.claude/agents/{solution-architect,domain-modeler,customer-feature-builder,subscription-feature-builder,external-services-builder,payment-feature-builder,test-and-dashboard-builder,frontend-builder,documentation-finalizer}.md`
- `backend/.gitkeep`, `frontend/.gitkeep`

### Verification commands the student should run
- `ls .claude/agents/` — should list 9 `.md` files
- `git log --oneline` — should show one commit
- `git status` — should be clean

### Notes for the next agent (`solution-architect`)
- The repository is empty of code. `backend/` contains only `.gitkeep`. You will run `dotnet new sln -n SubscriptionApp` inside `backend/` and delete the `.gitkeep` once real files exist (or leave it — your call, document it).
- `SPEC.md` defines the tech stack, project layout, and naming. Do not deviate.
- `AGENTS.md` defines the rules of engagement. Read both before doing anything.

### Open questions raised
- None.

## Phase 1 — solution-architect — 2026-05-11

### What was built
- `.NET 10` solution `SubscriptionApp.slnx` in `/backend` (see Key Decisions for version deviation)
- 4 projects scaffolded and added to the solution:
  - `SubscriptionApp.Api` (`dotnet new webapi --use-controllers`) — target `net10.0`
  - `SubscriptionApp.Domain` (`dotnet new classlib`) — target `net10.0`, **zero NuGet dependencies**
  - `SubscriptionApp.Infrastructure` (`dotnet new classlib`) — target `net10.0`
  - `SubscriptionApp.Tests` (`dotnet new xunit`) — target `net10.0`
- Project references wired: Api→Infrastructure+Domain, Infrastructure→Domain, Tests→Api+Infrastructure+Domain
- NuGet packages installed (all resolved to their latest stable versions for .NET 10):
  - **Api:** Swashbuckle.AspNetCore 10.1.7, FluentValidation.AspNetCore 11.3.1, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design 10.0.7
  - **Infrastructure:** Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore 10.0.7, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer 10.0.7, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools 10.0.7
  - **Tests:** Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory 10.0.7, FluentAssertions 8.9.0, xunit 2.9.3
- `appsettings.json` — `DefaultConnection` SQL Server (Docker) connection string added
- `Program.cs` — minimal skeleton with Swashbuckle Swagger UI (dev only), controller registration, and `TODO` placeholder comments for every future registration (DbContext, FluentValidation, services, middleware, DbInitializer)
- Deleted template-generated `WeatherForecast.cs` and `Controllers/WeatherForecastController.cs`
- `backend/.gitkeep` deleted (replaced by real content)
- Build result: **0 errors, 0 warnings**

### Key decisions
- Decision: used .NET 10.0.203 (current LTS). Reason: .NET 10 is installed and matches the spec. All EF Core, Swashbuckle, and FluentValidation packages resolved to their .NET 10 stable versions.
- Decision: solution file is `.slnx` (new XML format), not `.sln`. Reason: `dotnet new sln` in .NET 10 generates `.slnx` by default. All `dotnet` CLI commands accept `.slnx`. Alternative: force `.sln` with `--format sln` — unnecessary and `.slnx` is the forward-looking standard.
- Decision: kept `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` 10.0.7 in the Api csproj even though we use Swashbuckle. Reason: it was added by the webapi template and Swashbuckle may use it transitively. Alternative: remove it — benign either way; left it to avoid touching auto-generated project files needlessly.
- Decision: `Program.cs` uses Swashbuckle (`AddSwaggerGen` / `UseSwagger` / `UseSwaggerUI`) rather than the .NET 10 built-in `AddOpenApi()`. Reason: spec explicitly lists Swashbuckle for Swagger UI. Built-in OpenAPI generates JSON but has no UI endpoint.
- Decision: `backend/.gitkeep` was deleted after real files landed. Alternative: leave it — deleted to keep the directory clean.

### Files created/modified
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.slnx`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Api/SubscriptionApp.Api.csproj`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Api/Program.cs` (rewritten)
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Api/appsettings.json` (connection string added)
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Api/Controllers/` (WeatherForecastController.cs deleted)
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Api/WeatherForecast.cs` (deleted)
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Domain/SubscriptionApp.Domain.csproj`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Infrastructure/SubscriptionApp.Infrastructure.csproj`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Tests/SubscriptionApp.Tests.csproj`

### Verification commands the student should run
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/share/dotnet"   # add to your shell profile
cd backend
dotnet build SubscriptionApp.slnx             # should print: Build succeeded. 0 Warning(s) 0 Error(s)
```

### Notes for the next agent (`domain-modeler`)
- Solution compiles clean. `Domain` csproj has zero NuGet packages — keep it that way.
- `Program.cs` has placeholder `TODO` comments exactly where you need to add `AddDbContext<AppDbContext>` and the `DbInitializer` call — do not restructure the file, just fill in the TODOs.
- The connection string is at `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` in `appsettings.json`.
- **Database:** SQL Server 2022 via Docker — best fit for a .NET banking case study. Start the container before running migrations: `docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=1' -e 'MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=YourStrong!Passw0rd' -p 1433:1433 -d --name subscriptionapp-db mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge`. The connection string in `appsettings.json` is pre-configured to match this container.

### Open questions raised
- None.

## Phase 2 — domain-modeler — 2026-05-11

### What was built

**Domain project** (zero NuGet dependencies — verified):
- `Enums/SubscriptionType.cs` — Electricity(0), Water(1), Internet(2), Gsm(3), NaturalGas(4)
- `Enums/SubscriptionStatus.cs` — Active(0), Passive(1)
- `Enums/PaymentStatus.cs` — Successful(0), Failed(1) — **Successful must remain 0** (filtered index relies on this)
- `Entities/Customer.cs`, `Subscription.cs`, `Payment.cs` — pure POCOs, no EF attributes, non-virtual nav properties
- `Exceptions/DomainException.cs` (base, maps to 409), `DuplicatePaymentException`, `InactiveSubscriptionException`, `InvalidPeriodException`, `NotFoundException` (maps to 404, NOT a DomainException subclass)

**Infrastructure project:**
- `Persistence/AppDbContext.cs` — three DbSets, applies configurations via `ApplyConfiguration`
- `Persistence/Configurations/CustomerConfiguration.cs` — unique index on Email, max lengths
- `Persistence/Configurations/SubscriptionConfiguration.cs` — compound unique index on (ProviderName, SubscriptionNumber), CASCADE FK to Customer
- `Persistence/Configurations/PaymentConfiguration.cs` — `decimal(18,2)` on Amount, Period maxLength 7, filtered unique index on (SubscriptionId, Period) WHERE [Status] = 0, CASCADE FK to Subscription
- `Persistence/DbInitializer.cs` — idempotent seed: 3 customers (Ahmet Yılmaz, Fatma Kaya, Mehmet Demir), 5 subscriptions (BEDAŞ, Türk Telekom, İSKİ, Türkcell, İGDAŞ)

**Api project:**
- `Program.cs` — wired `AddDbContext<AppDbContext>` with `UseSqlServer`, seeder called on startup in Development

**Migration:**
- `InitialCreate` generated and applied. `SubscriptionAppDb` created in the Docker SQL Edge container.

### Key decisions
- Decision: `NotFoundException` is NOT a subclass of `DomainException`. Reason: 404 (not found) is semantically different from 409 (business rule violation). Sharing the same base class would require the middleware to differentiate by type anyway. Alternative: single base Exception hierarchy — rejected to keep the middleware mapping explicit and readable.
- Decision: Period validated in service layer, not via DB CHECK constraint. Reason: SQL Server's LIKE-based CHECK constraints cannot fully validate `YYYY-MM` (they cannot enforce the month range 01–12). Service-layer validation is simpler and sufficient given the layered-defense approach. Alternative: add a partial CHECK `LIKE '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[01][0-9]'` — rejected because it still allows months 13–19 and adds schema complexity for marginal benefit.
- Decision: Nav properties are non-virtual. Reason: lazy loading is disabled. Non-virtual nav properties enable explicit `.Include()` queries in services without the risk of N+1 surprises from accidental lazy loads. Alternative: omit nav properties entirely — rejected because explicit `.Include()` in service queries is cleaner than manual FK joins.
- Decision: `PaymentStatus.Successful = 0` is documented with an inline comment in `PaymentStatus.cs`. Reason: the filtered index `[Status] = 0` will silently break if this value ever changes. The comment makes the coupling visible to future developers.

### Files created/modified
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Domain/Enums/SubscriptionType.cs`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Domain/Enums/SubscriptionStatus.cs`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Domain/Enums/PaymentStatus.cs`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Domain/Entities/Customer.cs`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Domain/Entities/Subscription.cs`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Domain/Entities/Payment.cs`

- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Infrastructure/Persistence/Configurations/CustomerConfiguration.cs`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Infrastructure/Persistence/Configurations/SubscriptionConfiguration.cs`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Infrastructure/Persistence/Configurations/PaymentConfiguration.cs`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Infrastructure/Persistence/DbInitializer.cs`
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Infrastructure/Migrations/` (InitialCreate)
- `backend/SubscriptionApp.Api/Program.cs` (DbContext + DbInitializer wired)

### Verification commands the student should run
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/share/dotnet:$HOME/.dotnet/tools"
cd backend

# Migration is applied — confirm:
dotnet ef migrations list --project SubscriptionApp.Infrastructure --startup-project SubscriptionApp.Api
# Expected: 20260511122352_InitialCreate (Applied)

# Build still clean:
dotnet build SubscriptionApp.slnx

# Start the API and open Swagger:
dotnet run --project SubscriptionApp.Api
# Navigate to http://localhost:5000/swagger
# (No endpoints yet — but the app should start without errors and seed data runs)
```

### Errata / runtime observations
- App listens on **http://localhost:5072** (set by `launchSettings.json`), not port 5000. The `ExternalServices:BaseUrl` key in `appsettings.json` (added in Phase 5) must use `http://localhost:5072`. The `external-services-builder` agent must update this value — add a note when it runs.

### Notes for the next agent (`customer-feature-builder`)
- All entities, enums, and exceptions are in place. The Domain project has zero NuGet dependencies.
- `AppDbContext` is registered as Scoped (default for `AddDbContext`). Services that use it should also be Scoped.
- Nav properties are non-virtual — always use explicit `.Include()` in queries; never rely on lazy loading.
- `NotFoundException` does NOT inherit from `DomainException`. The exception middleware must catch them separately: `NotFoundException` → 404, `DomainException` → 409.
- The `DomainException` base class exposes a `Code` string (e.g. `"DUPLICATE_PAYMENT"`) — use this as the `code` field in the error response shape.
- DbInitializer seeds on every `Development` startup (idempotent — skips if data exists). Don't add seeding logic elsewhere.
- Folder conventions to follow for services: `Infrastructure/Services/`, for controllers: `Api/Controllers/`, for DTOs: `Api/Dtos/<Resource>/`, for validators: `Api/Validators/<Resource>/`, for mappings: `Api/Mapping/`.

### Open questions raised
- None.

## Phase 3 — customer-feature-builder — 2026-05-11

### What was built

**Api project:**
- `Dtos/Customers/CreateCustomerRequest.cs` — `FullName`, `Email`, `PhoneNumber`
- `Dtos/Customers/CustomerResponse.cs` — mirrors entity + `SubscriptionCount` (computed from nav property)
- `Validators/Customers/CreateCustomerRequestValidator.cs` — `NotEmpty` + `MaximumLength` on all fields; `EmailAddress()` on Email; Turkish phone regex `^\+90[0-9]{10}$` with custom message on PhoneNumber
- `Mapping/CustomerMappings.cs` — static extension methods `ToEntity(this CreateCustomerRequest)` and `ToResponse(this Customer)`; `SubscriptionCount` uses `?.Count ?? 0` to handle cases where nav property is not loaded
- `Controllers/CustomersController.cs` — `GET /api/customers`, `GET /api/customers/{id}`, `POST /api/customers` (201 + Location header), `DELETE /api/customers/{id}` (204)
- `Middleware/ExceptionHandlingMiddleware.cs` — catches `NotFoundException` → 404, `DomainException` → 409, `Exception` → 500; uniform JSON shape `{ "error": { "code", "message" } }`
- `Program.cs` — updated with `AddFluentValidationAutoValidation()`, `AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<CreateCustomerRequestValidator>()`, `AddScoped<ICustomerService, CustomerService>()`, `UseMiddleware<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware>()` (first middleware), custom `InvalidModelStateResponseFactory` returning consistent 400 error shape

**Infrastructure project:**
- `Services/ICustomerService.cs` — `GetAllAsync`, `GetByIdAsync`, `CreateAsync`, `DeleteAsync`
- `Services/CustomerService.cs` — EF Core scoped service; email uniqueness check throws `DomainException("DUPLICATE_EMAIL", …)`; `GetAllAsync` and `GetByIdAsync` use `.Include(c => c.Subscriptions)` for SubscriptionCount; `CreatedAt` set to `DateTime.UtcNow` in `CreateAsync`

**Build result:** `0 errors, 0 warnings`

### Key decisions
- Decision: `InvalidModelStateResponseFactory` overrides the default ASP.NET Core 400 response shape. Reason: FluentValidation auto-validation produces `ValidationProblemDetails` by default, which differs from the spec's `{ "error": { "code", "message", "details" } }` shape. Overriding the factory keeps all error shapes uniform without needing to catch `ValidationException` in the middleware. Alternative: catch `FluentValidation.ValidationException` in middleware — rejected because FluentValidation auto-validation swallows the exception before it propagates; the factory override is the correct integration point.
- Decision: `ICustomerService` and `CustomerService` live in `Infrastructure/Services/` (not a separate `Application` layer). Reason: spec uses a pragmatic 3-layer architecture (Domain, Infrastructure, Api); adding an `Application` layer is a premature abstraction for this scope. Alternative: move to `Api/Services/` — rejected because services depend on `AppDbContext` which lives in Infrastructure, so co-locating them avoids a circular reference.
- Decision: Service methods operate on domain entities (`Customer`), not DTOs. Reason: keeps the service layer reusable across controllers without depending on Api-layer types. Mapping happens at the controller boundary only. Alternative: pass DTOs all the way through — rejected per SPEC.md working principle "DTOs only at the API boundary."
- Decision: `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` does NOT handle `FluentValidation.ValidationException`. Reason: with `AddFluentValidationAutoValidation()`, validation failures are caught by the MVC pipeline and routed to `InvalidModelStateResponseFactory` before the action executes. The exception never reaches middleware. Alternative: disable auto-validation and throw manually — rejected; more boilerplate with no benefit.
- Decision: Middleware is registered as the very first `app.Use*` call (before seeding, Swagger, routing). Reason: ensures that any unhandled exception thrown during request processing — including from controllers, services, and future middleware — is caught. Alternative: register after Swagger/HTTPS — rejected because exceptions from those middlewares would bypass the handler.

# Navigate to http://localhost:5072/swagger

# GET  /api/customers/1         → 200 with Ahmet Yılmaz + SubscriptionCount = 2
# POST /api/customers { "fullName":"Test","email":"t@t.com","phoneNumber":"+905551111111" }
#                               → 201 with Location header

# POST /api/customers { "phoneNumber":"bad" } → 400 { "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", ... } }
# GET  /api/customers/9999      → 404 { "error": { "code": "NOT_FOUND", ... } }
# DELETE /api/customers/{id}    → 204
```

### Notes for the next agent (`subscription-feature-builder`)
- The customer vertical-slice is the template to follow: DTOs in `Api/Dtos/<Resource>/`, validators in `Api/Validators/<Resource>/`, service interface + implementation in `Infrastructure/Services/`, hand-written mapping in `Api/Mapping/`, thin controller in `Api/Controllers/`.
- `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` is already in place. Do NOT modify it — just throw the right domain exceptions from your service and they will be caught automatically.
- `NotFoundException` → 404, `DomainException` → 409. Both constructors require `(string code, string message)`.
- For the subscription `PUT` endpoint: allow updating `Status`, `ProviderName`, `BillingDayOfMonth` — never `CustomerId`. Validate `BillingDayOfMonth` between 1 and 28 in the validator.
- Register `ISubscriptionService → SubscriptionService` (Scoped) in `Program.cs` — a `TODO` comment is already there.
- The `GET /api/subscriptions?customerId=` filter endpoint should return all subscriptions for a customer, including the customer's FullName in the response DTO.

### Open questions raised
- None.

---

## Phase 4 — subscription-feature-builder — 2026-05-11

### What was built

Mirrors the customer vertical slice exactly for Subscriptions.

**Api project:**
- `Dtos/Subscriptions/CreateSubscriptionRequest.cs` — `CustomerId`, `SubscriptionType`, `ProviderName`, `SubscriptionNumber`, `BillingDayOfMonth`
- `Dtos/Subscriptions/UpdateSubscriptionRequest.cs` — `Status`, `ProviderName`, `BillingDayOfMonth` (no `CustomerId`)
- `Dtos/Subscriptions/SubscriptionResponse.cs` — all entity fields + `CustomerFullName` (from nav property)
- `Validators/Subscriptions/CreateSubscriptionRequestValidator.cs` — `IsInEnum()` for `SubscriptionType`, `InclusiveBetween(1, 28)` for `BillingDayOfMonth`, `NotEmpty` + `MaximumLength` for strings
- `Validators/Subscriptions/UpdateSubscriptionRequestValidator.cs` — same BillingDayOfMonth rule, `IsInEnum()` for Status
- `Mapping/SubscriptionMappings.cs` — `ToEntity(this CreateSubscriptionRequest)`, `ToResponse(this Subscription)` (CustomerFullName via `?.FullName ?? ""`)
- `Controllers/SubscriptionsController.cs` — `GET /api/subscriptions?customerId=`, `GET /api/subscriptions/{id}`, `POST /api/subscriptions` (201), `PUT /api/subscriptions/{id}` (200), `DELETE /api/subscriptions/{id}` (204)
- `Program.cs` — added `using` for `Validators.Subscriptions`, registered `ISubscriptionService → SubscriptionService` (Scoped), removed TODO comment

**Infrastructure project:**
- `Services/ISubscriptionService.cs` — `GetAllAsync(int? customerId)`, `GetByIdAsync`, `CreateAsync`, `UpdateAsync`, `DeleteAsync`
- `Services/SubscriptionService.cs` — customer existence check on create (→ 404); compound uniqueness pre-check on create and on update when `ProviderName` changes (→ 409 `DUPLICATE_SUBSCRIPTION`); `Status` forced to `Active` on create; `CreatedAt` = `DateTime.UtcNow`; `GetByIdAsync` re-invoked after update to return the fully-joined entity

**Build result:** `0 errors, 0 warnings`

### Key decisions
- Decision: `UpdateAsync` signature is `(int id, SubscriptionStatus status, string providerName, int billingDayOfMonth)` — individual parameters rather than passing the request DTO into the service. Reason: the service lives in `Infrastructure`, which must not reference `Api` types. Passing the DTO would create a downward dependency from Infrastructure → Api. Alternative: define a shared update model in Domain or Infrastructure — rejected as premature abstraction for three scalar fields.
- Decision: `CreateAsync` re-fetches the entity via `GetByIdAsync` after insert to return the Customer nav property populated. Reason: after `SaveChangesAsync()` the newly inserted `Subscription` only has `CustomerId` set; the `Customer` nav property is `null`. The controller would produce `CustomerFullName: ""` without a re-fetch. Alternative: attach the Customer manually after save — rejected as more fragile than a clean re-fetch.
- Decision: `UpdateAsync` also re-fetches via `GetByIdAsync` after update. Same reason as above.
- Decision: Duplicate subscription pre-check on both create and update. Reason: the DB filtered unique index is the safety net, but a pre-check gives a user-readable `DUPLICATE_SUBSCRIPTION` error rather than a SQL Server `SqlException`. On update, the check is only performed when `ProviderName` changes (since `SubscriptionNumber` is immutable), avoiding a spurious query on every PUT.
- Decision: `AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<CreateCustomerRequestValidator>()` already registered in Phase 3 picks up all validators in the `SubscriptionApp.Api` assembly, including the two new Subscription validators. No additional call needed. Reason: `AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<T>` scans the entire assembly, not just one namespace.

#                                            → 200 with updated fields
# DELETE /api/subscriptions/{id}             → 204 (cascades to Payments)
```

### Notes for the next agent (`external-services-builder`)
- The `SubscriptionService.GetAllAsync` accepts a nullable `int?` and applies a WHERE filter only when provided. This pattern can be reused for payment filtering by `subscriptionId`.
- Cascade delete to Payments is already configured in `PaymentConfiguration.cs` (Phase 2). No additional code needed.
- `ExternalServices:BaseUrl` in `appsettings.json` must be `http://localhost:5072` (see Phase 2 errata — app listens on port 5072, not 5000).
- The three mock external controllers go in `Api/Controllers/External/` as a sub-namespace. The three typed `HttpClient` interfaces + implementations go in `Infrastructure/ExternalServices/`. Register each with `AddHttpClient<TInterface, TImpl>()` in `Program.cs` pointing to the `ExternalServices:BaseUrl` config key.
